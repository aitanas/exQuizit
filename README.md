## Description

A React web application that utilizes flash cards and quizzes to help the user with studying Software Engineering terms and concepts.

### Objectives (MVP)

* **Flash Cards:** User should be presented a flash card with a question. The flash card may be "flipped" on click to display the answer.
* **Database:** NoSQL database created with Firebase and populated with study questions and answers
* **Tags:** Questions should be sorted into categories, with a `tags` key displaying one of the following categories:
  * `cs` : for logic, data structure, and theory based questions
  * `javascript` : JavaScript specific questions
  * `csharp` : C# specific questions

### Further Exploration (Stretch Goals)

* **Quizzes:** Implement quizzes with the existing Firebase dataset
* **Authentication and Authorization:** Users can create and log in to a personal account
* **Typed Answers**: Users may type in the answer to a question instead of flipping a flash card
